  <h2>My Perfect Date Would Be</h2>
  <p>I don't know how many times I've said this but I really reall really really like long romantic walks on the beach. Every german shepherd has a soft side. Mine is just aspecially soft. We could show up with our owners and a frisby to play catch, and cap off the night with a beautiful sunset setting over the mountains in the horizon.</p>
  <p>To cap off the night we will grab a bite to eat. Nothing high maintenance, just a quick bite so I can get a sense of your dog-nality.</p>
